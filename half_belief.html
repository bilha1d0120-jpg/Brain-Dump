          <div class="episode-desc">
            She arrives at a house party hosted by a mutual friend — unexcited, mostly showing up for the sake of it. The kind of night where you smile out of politeness, scroll through your phone in corners, and hope the people are decent.<br><br>
            Then there’s him. Loud, effortlessly social, at the centre of everything. The kind of person who fills a room without trying, with his storytelling, teasing, dancing like nobody’s watching. She notices him and realizes who the life of the party is.

          <div class="episode-title">Episode 2: “Passing Through”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            The party moves around them like a blur of conversations, music, and laughter. He is everywhere — laughing loudly, dancing with friends, spilling snacks on the carpet, stealing everyone's attention without trying.<br><br>
            She floats through it all, observing more than participating. They don’t talk; not properly, just cross paths briefly.<br>
            Nothing is said. Nothing stands out.<br>
            And yet, in the swirl of chaos, they both notice each other… quietly, momentarily, and without knowing why.<br>
            They leave without saying anything meaningful. Just a generic goodbye, like the kind you give strangers after a decent night. No names. No connections.

          <div class="episode-title">Episode 3: “A Quiet Exit”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            The next morning, she heads upstairs not expecting much, just following a quiet instinct. She walks in on the guy and his friend mid-conversation, both caught completely off guard at the sight of her.<br><br>
            There’s a flash of surprise, a bit of awkward laughter, and then everything settles into a soft, casual stillness.<br>
            She joins them for a few minutes, a light chat, a shared laugh, a silent thank you for last night’s energy. It’s unplanned, simple, and a little odd… in a good way.<br>
            When she leaves, it feels complete.<br>
            They don’t exchange socials or numbers.<br>
            They don’t expect to meet again.<br>
            Just a passing moment — sweet, small, and over.

          <div class="episode-title">Episode 1: “We Talked”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            They meet again after a few months but this time it is not just a passing hello. The evening turns into a night of easy banter, casual flirting, and slow teasing. Laughter flows, shoulders brush, comfort builds. By the time the sky starts to blush with the first light of dawn, they’ve watched it together.<br>
            The night gave them a soft beginning. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just fleeting.

          <div class="episode-title">Episode 2: “Arms That Knew”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            Blankets are shared, limbs tangled in lazy comfort. Conversations drift between stories and silences. There’s something about the way vulnerability sneaks in, like it belongs. There’s no label, no intent, just a rhythm they fall into without noticing.<br>
            So many stories exchanged, endless whispers and laughters.

        <li class="episode-item">
          <div class="episode-title">Episode 3: “Dance Me Out”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            A night out. A club. Everyone’s loud, but they’re louder; with joy, with mischief, with glances that linger. She lets herself go, swaying freely, sipping something fizzy. He follows her lead this time. It’s not just him lighting up the space. She’s the storm too.<br>
            They didn’t need to dance together. The whole night was in sync anyway.

          <div class="episode-title">Episode 4: “The Kiss That Wasn't”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            In the blur of closeness, he kisses her shoulder; spontaneous, thoughtless. She freezes for a beat, then turns it into a game. The next hours are pure chaos, her playfully tormenting him, him trying to win back balance. It’s flirty tension, fire with a grin.<br>
            He slipped. She didn’t fall — she made him sweat instead.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="episode-item">
          <div class="episode-title">Episode 5: “Wait Room”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            She has a doctor’s appointment and reaches out to him not thinking much of it. He’s agreed without thinking twice. In the waiting room, he is busy tending his sweet tooth. She watches him laugh and thinks — maybe, just maybe, she missed noticing him all this while.<br>
            Some people take your mind off the pain. He didn’t even try.

        <li class="episode-item">
          <div class="episode-title">Episode 6: “No strings attached?”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            Another night, another late conversation, but this time it feels heavier. They talk about serendipity, about wrong timings, about not knowing what this is but feeling it anyway. Jokes cover what neither of them wants to maybe acknowledge. There’s a pause — soft and hanging — as if both are asking: what is this?<br>
            Whatever it was, it was just carefree.

        <li class="episode-item">
          <div class="episode-title">Episode 7: “Seventh Day”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            She leans in. Finally. A kiss — quiet and full. They laugh after, not out of awkwardness, but the joy of it all. He says, “Even god took rest on the seventh day.” She laughs. That night becomes theirs.<br>
            They paused time instead.
          </div>

          <div class="episode-title">Episode 8: “Numbers and Nothing More”</div>
          <div class="episode-desc">
            The trip ends. Social handles are shared with a smile, but no illusions. They both know — different cities, different lives. They hug expecting it to be a last meet (again). No promises. No regrets. Just a goodbye steeped in sweetness.<br>
            They left no threads hanging. Just a feeling floating.

          <div class="episode-desc">
            The screen goes black after the goodbye. Then...<br>
            A notification lights up: “Hey. Home yet?”<br>
            A ringtone buzzes.<br>
            One picks up.<br>
            It is now going to be a digital buzz.
