      title: "Lost Day",
      genre: "Thriller | Mystery",
      synopsis: "Aamir walks into a hospital for a routine procedure — and wakes up in a different building, on a different day. September 21st has vanished. The police are looking for him, the news has named him a suspect, and there’s no trace of what happened while he was unconscious. As he races to piece together the missing 24 hours, Aamir finds himself caught in a web of doubt, danger, and deception. Lost Day is a taut, real-time thriller about memory, identity, and the terrifying cost of losing time you can’t get back.",

      title: "The Nocturnal",
      genre: "Political Drama | Psychological Mystery",
      synopsis: "In a city that never sleeps, truth hides in plain sight. Aditya Rai is a young political figure on the rise — eloquent, composed, and publicly adored. But as the system around him twists deeper into illusion, a second self begins to take shape. Anonymous. Elusive. Watchful. With whispers of change echoing through newsrooms, temples, and streets alike, The Nocturnal is a slow-burning political drama about identity, power, and what remains when the spotlight fades. Sometimes, the only way to lead... is to vanish.",

      title: "Agent Pradeep",
      genre: "Spy Thriller | Dark Comedy",
      synopsis: "Some agents disappear. Others are erased. Pradeep was never the sharpest spy — but he had instincts. And that was enough... until it wasn’t. Years after a failed mission, he’s living in silence, hiding from the world and himself. But secrets don’t stay buried, and when a new threat emerges, so does a name no one expected to hear again. Agent Pradeep is a dry-witted, grounded espionage tale about survival, second chances, and a man who might still be dangerous — mostly by accident.",

      title: "Father Siju",
      genre: "Comedy Drama | Con Adventure",
      synopsis: "When a rule-breaking priest rules, trouble takes holy orders. Assigned to a quiet seminary to reform his ways, Father Siju isn’t looking for purpose — just a way out. But when he meets Little Maria, a sharp and spirited women, sparks fly and so do a few rules. What begins as mischief soon spirals into something far more thrilling. Father Siju is a smart, witty ride about temptation, trust, and two unlikely partners in crime finding something worth believing in.",

      title: "Abort. Reboot. Love.",
      genre: "Urban Drama | Anti-Romance",
      synopsis: "Tony and Sona weren’t supposed to know each other. A brief glance in a quiet room should have been the end of it. But the city keeps putting them in each other’s way — casually, inconveniently, relentlessly. With each encounter, the silence between them changes. Not quite strangers. Not quite something else. Abort. Reboot. Love. is a stripped-down, quietly charged story about timing, discomfort, and the slow, disjointed possibility of connection in a world that rarely gives closure.",

    {
      title: "Old Boy",
      genre: "Action Comedy",
      synopsis: "Decades after hanging up his guns, a once-feared hitman is pulled back in for one last mission — and it’s not exactly subtle. Slower, rustier, and a little too comfortable with retirement, he’s tasked with finding a kidnapped boy and keeping the body count low. The problem? He’s out of shape, out of practice... but somehow still the smartest man in the room. Old Boy is a sharp-tongued action comedy about a reluctant return, a missing kid, and a man trying to save the day without blowing it all up — literally.",

Roy, a man trapped in an ordinary life, begins to experience disturbing flashes of a life he doesn’t remember — one filled with blood, orders, and a dangerous calm. As pieces of his fractured identity claw their way back, he must face a terrifying truth: he wasn’t always this Roy. A taut psychological thriller layered with dark humor, Roy explores identity, memory, and the cost of running from the person you used to be.",
